This repo is for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the very awesome Odin Project :)

All the actual coding will be done with Vim, as it's something I've been interested in learning, all file and directory manipulation will be done with the terminal also. Mainly as a challenge to myself, to learn it :)

This is also a way for me to learn git, which has so far been a bit confusing to use... but it feels like it will be super useful and powerful once I have the hang of it!

By the end of this project, I will hopefully have built a very cool, interactive, and responsive website where I can showcase projects I'm working on!
